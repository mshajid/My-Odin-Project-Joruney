## What is **Odin Project**? 
---
The Odin Project also referred to "TOP" is a website that allows us to learn Full Stack Engineering to the best at Self-paced without any sandbox editor. 

The best thing about TOP is we have to do all out stuffs instead without dripping feed to us entire time, somewhat like reading documentation and for further explanation we have to go through the external sources to grasp the pattern or understading.
