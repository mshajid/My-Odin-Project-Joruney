First time writing markdown, and feel like I'm in love with this already - <mark>March 06 2023</mark>

## What is **Odin Project**? 
---
The Odin Project also referred to "TOP" is a website that allows us to learn Full Stack Engineering to the best at Self-paced without any sandbox editor. 

The best thing about TOP is we have to do all out stuffs instead without dripping feed to us entire time, somewhat like reading documentation and for further explanation we have to go through the external sources to grasp the pattern or understading. 

## About Me

My name is Shajid Shafee, 29 y/o from Sri Lanka. (*I'll about myself later* ðŸ˜†)

To be honest with you, I aspired to <mark>**become a Full Stack web developer**</mark>, not because of the fancy word behind but I really loved the workflow and thinking patterns, Compared to the other jobs or study, This made me realize.. Yo! Shajid you **found your purpose to live.** 

## ODIN Project is Hard. 
---
I really know that The Odin Project is pretty hard for newbies like me, and the sustainability and quitting ratio rather high compared to other courses around the web, for an Example, codecademy and etc.. 

But, I realized that to study ODIN you must consistently push yourself through the limits and all above that you need to become discipline and productive in order to achieve and abosrob the content like sponge and work flawlessly. 

So, this is one of my first initiation that adding my journey through the TOP with this Readme.md file. Also, I use several techniques to stay motivate discipline my entire journey, One technique is that I use Pomodro timer, Each sessions consist of 25 minutes., If the Each session completes then it equals to 1 Pomodro. 

This is how I personally recording my timelines and also here to help y'all out at ease.

**My Personal Mantra**: I don't want to break my warrior's code despite of having hardship through my nightshit career (9-12 hours a day)

I'll update this readme file everyday, and How I surpassed my day with The Odin Project. So let's get started.
